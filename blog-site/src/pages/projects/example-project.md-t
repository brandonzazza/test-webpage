This is where your project writeup goes. Write in plain Markdown.

## How to Write Projects

Create a new `.md` file in `src/pages/projects/`. The filename becomes the URL slug. For example, `my-project.md` becomes `/projects/my-project`.

## Frontmatter

Every project needs this metadata at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: ../../layouts/ProjectLayout.astro
title: "Project Name"
description: "Brief description"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
github: "https://github.com/..."   # Optional - delete if private/internal
demo: "https://..."                # Optional - delete if no live demo
date: 2025-01-20
---
```

### Optional Fields

- **github** — Link to source code. If omitted, no GitHub icon appears.
- **demo** — Link to live demo. If omitted, no demo link appears.

This is useful for internal/proprietary projects where you can't share the code.

## Suggested Sections

Here's a structure that works well for project writeups:

### Overview

What does this project do? Why did you build it?

### Features

- Feature one
- Feature two
- Feature three

### Technical Details

Explain the architecture, key decisions, or interesting implementation details.

```python
# Include code samples if relevant
def example():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

### Challenges & Lessons Learned

What problems did you encounter? What would you do differently?

### Results

Any metrics, outcomes, or impact from the project.

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `inline code`
- Lists (like this one)

### Code Blocks

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it for callouts or important notes.

### Images

Place images in `public/images/` and reference them:

```markdown
![Architecture diagram](/images/my-diagram.png)
```
